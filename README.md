Create a new branch where you're going to work on changes by typing `git checkout -b [new branch name]`. This will automatically switch you to the branch after it's created.

```bash
git checkout -b my-changes
Switched to a new branch 'my-changes'
```

Once your changes are complete, added, and committed, push the changes upstream to your local copy of the repository

```bash
git push origin my-changes
```

<br>
<br>
You'll see that you can now submit a pull request to merge your new branch with edits/additions to the main branch of the forked repository.
